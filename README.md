# Edgar Garcia's Data Science Portfolio

## Welcome

### Welcome to my data science portfolio. In the folders above are some of my data science projects that showcase my skills in data analysis, visualization, and machine learning. Below you will see a summary for each project.

## Black Friday Purchase Amount
#### Project Overview: For this project, I created a model in order to the predict the amount of a purchase made During Black Friday. The data was collected from one store during Black Friday. I used features such as user ID, product ID, gender, age, and marital status to help make predict the purchase amount. This informatio could prove useful in helping business to determine the profiles of the customers who spend the most during black Friday in order to increase sales for next year.

### Skills Showcased: EDA, data cleaning, feature selection, machine learning, regression

## Health Insurance Classification
#### Project Overview: Health insurance can be very expensive in the US, so for this project I wanted to determine the profiles of the people who spend the most on health insurance. The data was collected from four different regions in the US and contained information such as sex, age, bmi, smoker/nonsmoker, region, and charges. The goal of this project was to determine who paid the most for health insurance. This information can help people to understand what leads to higher health insruance costs and how to possible lower costs in the long run.

## Income Prediction
#### Project Overview: IThis project analyzes census demographic data, which includes data about if a person's income was over or under $50,000 for the year. This analysis was then used to create features to identify the demographic indicators that would then be used in models to predict if a person would earn over or under $50,000. This information could prove valuable because the Income Census Bureau may want to use this model for their annual income data to determine the profile of a person that makes above a certain amount and below a certain amount. They have the data, but may not be able to fully use the data to their advantage. By analyzing it and creating an accurate classification model, we could use it to determine what are the key factors that determine a person's income amount.
